# Mongodb-redis-database-project

This is a project for my Database Design course

This is program that uses mongodb and redis to save and display the customers, products, orders, and a total listing of all sales.  Customers and products can be deleted, edited, and added, well orders can only be added or removed.

Only the database.py was created by myself, the rest was supplied by the professor of the course
